            Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ` O' or an ` X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player to get three of the same symbols in a row.

            <p>Rock Paper Scissors</p>
            At the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.
